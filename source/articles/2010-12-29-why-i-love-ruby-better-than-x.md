I have uploaded my slide of my Ruby talk, [Why I love Ruby better than X](http://www.slideshare.net/samnang.chhun/why-i-love-ruby-than-x). I really enjoyed talking about this topic because Ruby is my first and favorite programming 
language. I show some reasons about why I love Ruby with its natural language. Unfortunately, Ruby is not very popular in my country(Cambodia), but I would love to see more and more people will get into it because of its power and freedom.
