According to the last month meetup at [Pailin](http://pailin.github.com/)(Cambodia Ruby/RubyOnRails User Group), most of the members are just getting started in Ruby. So I had a chance to give a presentation about **Interactive Ruby Learning** at this weekend for our Auguest meetup. I believe in Ruby's philosophy, so there should be different ways to have fun to learn Ruby.

> Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing.  
Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) , [The Philosophy of Ruby](http://www.artima.com/intv/rubyP.html)
