As I know there are some people are celebrating 12/12/12 is a special day for them, and they plan to do different things for their day. Then I think, why don't I do a special thing as well for today :)

I would like to say thank to awesome people who have done a great job to help me as well as community to live in a better place by building open source projects, sharing ideas/experiences, building better products, or doing a great job in some ways. I hope it helps to motivate those awesome people to keep continuing doing their great jobs.
