**UPDATE:** My slide is available [here](http://zero-to-ruby.heroku.com/) and [source](https://github.com/samnang/zero-to-ruby).

[OpenTechTalk](http://www.sharevisionteam.org/opentechtalk/) is coming on 22th Jan, I will give a talk about **Zero to Ruby**. Last month, I already gave a talk on [Why I love Ruby better than X](/2010/12/29/why-i-love-ruby-better-than-x/) at [DevCamp](http://www.sharevisionteam.org/devcamp/). Because Ruby communities in Cambodia are not so popular, and many people don't know even it exists. So I decide in the talk, I will give some introduction to Ruby, how to learn it, and some effective ways to learn it.

See you there together.
