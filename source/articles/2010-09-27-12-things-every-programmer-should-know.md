Last weekend, I had a chance to give a presentation about 
[12 Things Every Programmer Should Know](http://www.slideshare.net/samnang.chhun/12-things-every-programmer-should-know) 
at [BarCamp Phnom Penh 2010](http://barcampphnompenh.org/) which is a biggest IT event
in Cambodia. Cambodia is a developing country that still limited human resources, 
but it is growing so fast especially in IT industry. The presentation was a kind of 
motivation to programmers for career development. From my experience in doing 
programming about 5 years, I was so happy with this presentation because I hope the talk 
will help to explain about techniques, best practices, and attitudes of a good 
programmer/developer should has when he/she decided his/her career to stay in software development.
