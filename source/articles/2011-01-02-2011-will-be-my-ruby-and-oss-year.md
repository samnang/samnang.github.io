Last a few months, I have relearned my Ruby skill, and I have enjoyed the language. So this year I decided **2011** will be my Ruby year, and I will do open source projects and contribute to some existing open source projects in that technology.

There are a few things that I would like to focus and see them happen in 2011:

- Push my Ruby skills in doing exercises and projects in [RMU](http://university.rubymendicant.com/ "Ruby Mendicant University")
- Volunteer as a Ruby mentor at [RubyLearning](http://rubylearning.org/class/)
- Provide free a day Ruby course in my local country(Cambodia)
- Participate and contribute to open source projects by writting tests, blogging, and sending patches.
- Building good communities([ShareVisionTeam](http://sharevisionteam.org), [Paillin](http://groups.google.com/group/pailin)) 
in Cambodia.
- Improve web design skill.

This is going to be an exciting year!
